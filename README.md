# COVID-19 INFO

Here's a modified version of your README that now discusses COVID-19, maintaining the structure from your previous Bitcoin project:

COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
Data Loading:
The dataset covid19_data.csv was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Basic exploration included checking column names, structure (data types), and summary statistics of numerical columns. Missing values were handled, and the dataset was prepped for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics:
We calculated key statistics such as the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for important columns (e.g., Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered). These helped us understand the spread of the virus and overall trends in the data over time.

Correlation Analysis:
We computed the correlation between important variables, such as Confirmed Cases, Deaths, and Recovered cases, to identify relationships. For example, we checked the correlation between daily confirmed cases and daily deaths to understand how closely these two variables are related.

Price Range Calculation:
Since COVID-19 data doesnâ€™t involve prices, we replaced this with daily change calculations, such as the daily increase or decrease in confirmed cases. We created a new column, Daily Change, to capture this metric. Percentage changes between confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries were also computed.

Visualizations:
We visualized the Confirmed Cases, Deaths, and Recovered data over time. Line plots and histograms were generated to better understand the spread of the pandemic. We created histograms to show the distribution of daily changes in confirmed cases and deaths.

Interesting or Unexpected Observations:
A strong positive correlation was found between Confirmed Cases and Deaths, which is expected but reveals the severity of the pandemic. This highlights the relationship between rising case numbers and mortality rates.
Extreme Daily Changes: We identified certain days with unusually high or low changes in confirmed cases, likely due to external factors like changes in reporting, lockdown measures, or spikes related to super-spreader events.
Volume Doesn't Strongly Correlate with Cases:
Unlike financial markets where volume often affects prices, there was no strong relationship between the number of daily tests (volume) and the rate of confirmed cases. This might indicate that other factors, such as public policy changes or social behavior, played a more significant role in affecting case numbers.

Consistent Growth Trend:
Confirmed case numbers grew at a fairly consistent rate over time, showing a clear upward trajectory in several countries without extreme spikes. This reflects how the pandemic progressed over time, with steady increases across various regions.

Potential Explanations for High Correlation Between Confirmed Cases and Deaths:
COVID-19 case numbers are influenced by many factors, such as healthcare systems, government response, and population density. Unless there's significant intervention, case numbers generally rise over time, leading to an increase in deaths. We also explored the impact of vaccination campaigns and lockdowns on case trends.

Extreme Percentage Changes:
These might be linked to significant global events, such as lockdown implementations, new variants of the virus, or large-scale public health responses. We found that on some days, case numbers surged due to holiday travel, mass gatherings, or reopening of economies.

Follow-Up Questions for Future Analysis:
What external factors (e.g., government policies, vaccine rollouts, public health measures) have driven the days with extreme changes in confirmed cases?
Further analysis could include integrating external datasets (e.g., mobility data, hospital capacity) to see if they align with the spread of the virus.
