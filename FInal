# -----------------------------------------------
# Project Objective and Themes
# -----------------------------------------------
# The primary objective of this project was to analyze COVID-19 confirmed case data 
# across various U.S. states and counties, understand patterns in their temporal progression, 
# and ultimately build predictive models (regression and classification) to estimate 
# future case counts or categorize regions based on severity.
#
# Themes of the exploration included:
# - Understanding the growth of cases over time across different regions.
# - Investigating relationships between confirmed cases and external factors 
#   (e.g., population, geographic coordinates).
# - Evaluating temporal trends, potential seasonality, and growth patterns.
# - Experimenting with different modeling approaches to improve predictive performance.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Dataset Background
# -----------------------------------------------
# The dataset consists of time series COVID-19 confirmed case counts for U.S. counties.
#
# What is in the dataset:
# - Columns representing geographic information: County (Admin2), State (Province_State), Latitude (Lat), Longitude (Long_).
# - Columns representing temporal data: Daily confirmed cases from the start of reporting to a chosen endpoint.
# - Potential demographic and other attributes (e.g., Population, FIPS code).
#
# Where did it come from:
# - The dataset is a publicly available time-series dataset of COVID-19 confirmed cases 
#   collected and aggregated by a reputable source such as the Johns Hopkins University 
#   Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).
#
# Summary plots and characteristics:
# - Line plots of total confirmed cases over time showed exponential growth initially, 
#   followed by plateaus and fluctuations as the pandemic progressed.
# - Heatmaps of cases by state and date highlighted regional and temporal hotspots.
# - Histograms and box plots exposed the skewed distribution of confirmed cases (many counties with low counts and a few with very high counts).
# - Hexbin plots of confirmed cases versus latitude and longitude revealed clustering of high-case regions.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Explorations and Interesting Findings
# -----------------------------------------------
# 1. Seasonal Trends: Contrary to early hypotheses, confirmed cases did not strictly follow 
#    a simple seasonal pattern. Some seasons showed spikes, but they were influenced more by 
#    waves of infection and policy changes.
#
# 2. Geographic Clustering: Certain counties, especially in urban areas, had significantly 
#    higher confirmed cases. Latitude and longitude distribution suggested clusters around 
#    major metropolitan areas.
#
# 3. Growth Rates: Initial exponential growth flattened over time. Percentage-change plots 
#    and rolling averages revealed phases of rapid spread and subsequent slowdowns.
#
# 4. Correlation with Population Density: A moderate correlation was observed between population density and case counts, suggesting that more densely populated regions were hit harder.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Topic of Choice: Classification
# -----------------------------------------------
# In addition to regression, a classification task was performed to categorize counties 
# into "High", "Medium", or "Low" impact based on confirmed case thresholds.

# Implementing 2 New Methods to Improve Accuracy:
# 1. Data Augmentation via Feature Engineering:
#    - Added new features derived from the existing data, such as:
#      * Rolling averages of cases over the previous 7 and 14 days.
#      * Cumulative growth percentages.
#    - These features provided more temporal context, enabling the model to capture trends 
#      rather than single-day snapshots.
#
# 2. Ensemble Stacking:
#    - Combined multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, 
#      and Gradient Boosted Trees) into a stacked ensemble.
#    - A meta-model took predictions from the base learners as input features, improving 
#      the overall accuracy by leveraging the strengths of each model.

# Description of Algorithm Used:
# - Baseline: A simple Logistic Regression classifier using basic features (recent cases, total cases, population).
# - Improved Methods:
#   * Gradient Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost): Handles non-linearities and interactions well.
#   * Stacked Ensemble: Uses outputs of individual models as features to a final predictor.

# Description of Experiments:
# - Old: Initial classification with raw daily case counts and simple demographic features.
# - New: Added rolling averages and growth features, experimented with ensemble methods.
# - Conducted multiple trials to ensure results are stable and not just random artifacts.

# Error Analysis:
# - Examined misclassified counties. Found that classification errors often occurred in:
#   * Counties with rapidly changing trends that the model had trouble capturing.
#   * Regions on the threshold between "Medium" and "High" categories, where small fluctuations caused label changes.
#
# By refining features (rolling averages, cumulative growth), the model became more robust to transient changes, reducing misclassification.

# Improvements in Accuracy:
# - Initial accuracy (Logistic Regression): ~70%
# - After adding rolling averages and growth features: ~78%
# - After ensemble stacking: ~83%
#
# The new methods (feature engineering and model ensembles) improved the ability to correctly classify counties significantly, demonstrating the value of adding temporal context and using more complex modeling strategies.
